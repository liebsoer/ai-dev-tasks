# üöÄ AI Dev Tasks for Cursor ü§ñ

Welcome to **AI Dev Tasks**! This repository provides a collection of `.mdc` (Markdown Command) files designed to supercharge your feature development workflow within the [Cursor](https://cursor.sh/) editor. By leveraging these commands with Cursor's AI Agent, you can systematically approach building features, from ideation to implementation, with built-in checkpoints for verification.

Stop wrestling with monolithic AI requests and start guiding your AI collaborator step-by-step!

## ‚ú® The Core Idea

Building complex features with AI can sometimes feel like a black box. This workflow aims to bring structure, clarity, and control to the process by:

1.  **Defining Scope:** Clearly outlining what needs to be built with a Product Requirement Document (PRD).
2.  **Detailed Planning:** Breaking down the PRD into a granular, actionable task list.
3.  **Iterative Implementation:** Guiding the AI to tackle one task at a time, allowing you to review and approve each change.

This structured approach helps ensure the AI stays on track, makes it easier to debug issues, and gives you confidence in the generated code.

## Workflow: From Idea to Implemented Feature üí°‚û°Ô∏èüíª

Here's the step-by-step process using the `.mdc` files in this repository:

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Create a Product Requirement Document (PRD)

First, lay out the blueprint for your feature. A PRD clarifies what you're building, for whom, and why.

You can create a lightweight PRD directly within Cursor:

1.  Ensure you have the `create-prd.mdc` file from this repository accessible.
2.  In Cursor's Agent chat, initiate PRD creation:

    ```
    Use @create-prd.mdc
    Here's the feature I want to build: [Describe your feature in detail]
    Reference these files to help you: [Optional: @file1.py @file2.ts]
    ```
    *(Pro Tip: For complex PRDs, using MAX mode in Cursor is highly recommended if your budget allows for more comprehensive generation.)*

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Generate Your Task List from the PRD

With your PRD drafted (e.g., `MyFeature-PRD.md`), the next step is to generate a detailed, step-by-step implementation plan for your AI Developer.

1.  Ensure you have `generate-tasks-from-prd.mdc` accessible.
2.  In Cursor's Agent chat, use the PRD to create tasks:

    ```
    Now take @MyFeature-PRD.md and create tasks using @generate-tasks-from-prd.mdc
    ```
    *(Note: Replace `@MyFeature-PRD.md` with the actual filename of the PRD you generated in step 1.)*

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Examine Your Task List

You'll now have a well-structured task list, often with tasks and sub-tasks, ready for the AI to start working on. This provides a clear roadmap for implementation.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Instruct the AI to Work Through Tasks (and Mark Completion)

To ensure methodical progress and allow for verification, we'll use `process-task-list.mdc`. This command instructs the AI to focus on one task at a time and wait for your go-ahead before moving to the next.

1.  Create or ensure you have the `process-task-list.mdc` file accessible.
2.  In Cursor's Agent chat, tell the AI to start with the first task (e.g., `1.1`):

    ```
    Please start on task 1.1 and use @process-task-list.mdc
    ```
    *(Important: You only need to reference `@process-task-list.mdc` for the *first* task. The instructions within it guide the AI for subsequent tasks.)*

    The AI will attempt the task and then prompt you to review.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Review, Approve, and Progress ‚úÖ

As the AI completes each task, you review the changes.
*   If the changes are good, simply reply with "yes" (or a similar affirmative) to instruct the AI to mark the task complete and move to the next one.
*   If changes are needed, provide feedback to the AI to correct the current task before moving on.

You'll see a satisfying list of completed items grow, providing a clear visual of your feature coming to life!

- `@generate-tasks-infrastructure.mdc` for DevOps and infrastructure
- `@generate-tasks-mcp.mdc` for Model Context Protocol servers

### Multi-Template Application Scenarios

For complex applications that span multiple platforms or require different specialized components, you can use multiple templates in sequence or combination:

#### **Sequential Template Application**
For applications with distinct platform targets:

1. **Multi-Platform Applications:**
   ```
   // Start with the primary platform
   Now take @MyFeature-PRD.md and create tasks using @generate-tasks-web.mdc
   
   // After completing web tasks, generate mobile tasks
   Now create additional tasks for mobile deployment using @generate-tasks-mobile.mdc and integrate with existing task list
   
   // Finally, add desktop distribution tasks
   Now create desktop deployment tasks using @generate-tasks-desktop.mdc and merge with current roadmap
   ```

2. **Full-Stack Applications with Infrastructure:**
   ```
   // Start with frontend
   Now take @MyFeature-PRD.md and create tasks using @generate-tasks-web.mdc
   
   // Add backend/API tasks
   Now create backend tasks using @generate-tasks-cloud.mdc and coordinate with frontend tasks
   
   // Add deployment infrastructure
   Now create infrastructure tasks using @generate-tasks-infrastructure.mdc for the complete system
   ```

#### **Integrated Multi-Template Approach**
For applications requiring simultaneous development across platforms:

```
Create a comprehensive task list for @MyFeature-PRD.md using:
- @generate-tasks-web.mdc for the main web application
- @generate-tasks-mobile.mdc for mobile companion app
- @generate-tasks-cloud.mdc for backend services
- @generate-tasks-infrastructure.mdc for deployment pipeline

Please integrate these into a coordinated development timeline with shared libraries and synchronized milestones.
```

#### **Template Combination Strategies**

**Shared Component Library Approach:**
- Use `generate-tasks.mdc` for core shared components
- Apply specialized templates for platform-specific implementations
- Focus on maintaining consistent APIs and design systems

**Timeline Coordination:**
- **Sequential Development:** Add 30-50% to timelines for platform integration
- **Parallel Development:** Add 20-30% but requires larger team coordination
- **Shared Library First:** Add 40-60% upfront but reduces per-platform time by 25-35%

**Recommended Multi-Template Combinations:**

1. **Enterprise Web + Mobile:**
   - `generate-tasks-web.mdc` + `generate-tasks-mobile.mdc` + `generate-tasks-cloud.mdc`
   - Timeline: +60-80% vs single platform

2. **Desktop + Web Distribution:**
   - `generate-tasks-desktop.mdc` + `generate-tasks-web.mdc` + `generate-tasks-infrastructure.mdc`
   - Timeline: +45-65% vs single platform

3. **Full-Stack MCP Integration:**
   - `generate-tasks-mcp.mdc` + `generate-tasks-web.mdc` + `generate-tasks-infrastructure.mdc`
   - Timeline: +50-70% vs single platform

4. **Complete DevOps Pipeline:**
   - Primary template + `generate-tasks-infrastructure.mdc` + `generate-tasks-cloud.mdc`
   - Timeline: +70-120% for comprehensive automation
